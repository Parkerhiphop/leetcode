[About coding, growth and immigration](https://leetcode.com/discuss/career/217361/about-coding-growth-and-immigration)
In term of "solving" a problem, there are several levels we need to pursue:

(1) "Accepted": means that you can solve a given problem, coding it up, get "accepted";

(2) "Accepted anyway": means that you can solve the problem given some restrictions (e.g. can you solve it using divide & conquer ? ) and get accepted;

(3) "Analysis": means to analyze time & space, respond to a broader concept and view, solving even more challenging problems (like ones involving Distributed, Large-scale systems).

After accomplishing these levels for 100~200 problems, I am sure that you can crack most interviews no matter what :-) !

## Level of Leetcode
- Easy: One Concept
  - hashmap: [Valid Anagram](blind75/string/valid-anagram.md)
  - dfs: [Path Sum](daily/tree/path-sum.md)
  - ...
- Medium: Mixed of at least two concepts or Variation of Easy's concept
  - Circular + DP: [House Robber 2](blind75/dp/house-robber-2.md)

  - ???

## [Blind75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) Check list
> 在 notes/__.md 中整理 Blind75 這些題目會用到的演算法跟技巧（如： string.md -> string 使用到 hashmap, two pointer, dp, greedy 並在哪些題目 JOHN）
> Blind75 就像是講義、例題
> 第一次：先求解得出來、能慢慢判斷出題目可以使用哪些演算法跟資料結構來解，或是至少看得懂詳解。
> 第二次：開始能關注 TC / SC，並訓練自己獨立解題。
> DEMO: 可以參考 Type Challenge 那個做成一個 challenge & solution list！
