## Trie
A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings.

There are various applications of this data structure, such as `autocomplete` and `spellchecker`.

## Binary Heap
- use Priority Queue 
- To do Heap Sort

There are Min Heap and Max Heap.
